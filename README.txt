No special instructions for running the my app. Just open index.html where it is within the folder.

c) 
I chose to use a sidebar so that users could move through commentors easy. I showed only the results from the original search first, then allowed users to choose whether they could see other comments by that user. I used several popup windows as a way of letting the user see more information without losing their current search, such as the associated article, the help page, or the rankings. The three floating buttons for "search again", "help page", and "ranks" are within easy reach of users as it follows them wherever they scroll. I also made sure to show what the users had filtered for on the top right hand corner, in case they forgot.
